# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- New `resolveSessionId` option on all four adapter middlewares (Express, Fastify, Hono, Next.js). Pass a function `(req) => string | null` and the middleware will use that to look up the DBSC session instead of reading the bound cookie. This is the supported way to wire DBSC into an application that already has its own session cookie.

  Without a resolver the middleware fell back to reading only the bound `__Host-dbsc-session` cookie, which is short-lived and Chrome-managed and frequently absent during normal operation (between refresh cycles, after a refresh failure, etc.). Applications that gated identity on the middleware's `sessionId` saw spurious "not authenticated" results even for valid users.

  With a resolver the recommended pattern is: authentication identity lives in the app's own session cookie, tier negotiation lives in the bound cookie, the two are intentionally separate.

- `getDbscSession()` on the Next.js adapter accepts an optional `resolveSessionId` third argument with the same semantics.

### Fixed

- The Express demo (`examples/express`) previously used the DBSC bound cookie as the authentication identity. That worked until the bound cookie expired or refresh failed, after which `/me` returned not-authenticated for legitimate users. The demo now uses a separate `__Host-app-session` cookie for identity and wires the new `resolveSessionId` option, plus a `/payment` endpoint that demonstrates a real tier-gated route.

### Compatibility

`resolveSessionId` is optional. Existing code without it behaves exactly as before.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- Fastify, Hono, and Next.js adapters now match the Express adapter on the Chrome 147 wire format. They return 200 with the JSON session config on registration and refresh success (instead of 204), 403 on refresh missing proof (instead of 401), and read the session id from the `Sec-Secure-Session-Id` header during refresh (instead of relying on the bound cookie, which is gone by then). Without these, Chrome accepted registration but silently terminated the session on the first refresh.

### Changed

- Bumped core dependencies to their current majors: `jose` 6, `@simplewebauthn/server` 13, plus matching dev dependency updates for `vitest` 4, `typescript` 6, `rimraf` 6.
- Peer dependency ranges raised: `fastify >=5`, `express >=5`, `@fastify/cookie >=11`, `next >=15`. Consumers on older majors should pin to `dbsc-toolkit@1.0.1`.
- CI now uses `npm ci` instead of `npm install` so installs are deterministic against the lockfile.
- GitHub Actions runners updated to `actions/checkout@v6`, `actions/setup-node@v6`, `github/codeql-action@v4`.
- Dependabot configured for weekly minor/patch updates on npm and GitHub Actions, with major bumps held back for manual review.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-16

First public release.

### Highlights

- Single npm package with subpath exports for each adapter and storage backend. Install once, pick a framework and a storage at import time.
- Adapters shipped: Express, Fastify, Hono, Next.js (App Router middleware + handler).
- Storage adapters shipped: in-memory (dev/test), Redis (`ioredis`), PostgreSQL (`pg`).
- Browser SDK for the WebAuthn and HMAC fallback paths.
- Verified end-to-end against Chrome 147 on Windows with a real TPM. Bound cookie issuance, registration, automatic refresh, tier negotiation, and stolen-cookie detection all working.

### Protocol coverage

- Registration: ES256/RS256 JWS verification, single-use challenge JTI, JSON session config response body required by Chrome 147.
- Refresh: 403 + `Secure-Session-Challenge` for missing proof, session ID read from the `Sec-Secure-Session-Id` header, JWS-signed challenge verified against the bound JWK.
- Header constants exported under both the current `Secure-Session-*` names and the legacy `Sec-Session-*` aliases. The library reads both inbound and writes both outbound for cross-version compatibility.

### Fallback tiers

- Tier negotiation per session: `dbsc` → `webauthn` → `hmac` → `none`. Tier is exposed on every request so applications can apply per-tier authorization policies.

### Telemetry

- Typed events: `registration`, `refresh`, `verification_failure`, `session_stolen`, `fallback_tier`. No logger dependency — wire into any observability stack via the `onEvent` callback.

### Documentation

- Twelve docs under `docs/` covering getting started, API reference, adapters (with a custom-adapter walkthrough for raw `http`, Bun, Deno), storage (with custom storage adapter), protocol, fallback tiers, telemetry, security best practices, threat model, deployment, and troubleshooting.

### Peer dependencies

All framework and database integrations are optional peer dependencies. A consumer using only Express + in-memory storage installs `dbsc-toolkit` plus `express` and nothing else.
